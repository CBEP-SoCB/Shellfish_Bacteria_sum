```

# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Missing Data
```{r}
with(coli_data, length(ColiVal))
with(coli_data, sum(is.na(ColiVal)))
```

What does it mean to have missing values in this context?  That is not entirely
clear, but these appear to be samples that are recorded with all site
information, but no sample-related information, so my guess is, these represent
samples that were scheduled but not actually collected.

That suggests we should simply drop these rows as uninformative.  We hold off on
doing that for now, as we want to explore the structure of the data.

## What values are represented in our data?
(Note that `ColiVal` has addressed inconsistent handling of non-detects, by
rebuilding numeric data from the source.  `ColiVal` includes censored values.
Censoring is shown with `LCFlag` and `RCFlag`).

```{r fig.width = 7}
test <- coli_data %>%
  select(ColiVal, RCFlag, LCFlag ) %>%
  group_by(factor(ColiVal)) %>%
  select(-ColiVal) %>%
  rename(ColiVal =`factor(ColiVal)`) %>%
  summarize(some_censored = as.logical(sum(any(RCFlag | LCFlag))),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(row = row_number(),
         ColiVal = as.numeric(as.character(ColiVal)))
  
ggplot(test, aes(row, ColiVal)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = some_censored))
```

### Low Values
```{r}
test$ColiVal[which(test$ColiVal <= 10)]
```

### Non-integer Values
Non-integer values include the following:

```{r}
test$ColiVal[which(test$ColiVal != as.integer(test$ColiVal))]
```

These are discrete, low, non-integer values.  Presumably these reflect the
possible numerical values derived from the methods used to estimate number
of colony forming units in each water sample.

## Exploratory Graphics
```{r}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(SDateTime, ColiVal)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=LCFlag | RCFlag)) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

This shows us:
1.  The discrete of values observed
2.  The importance of censoring
3.  Possible coding errors where censored values were perhaps not consistently
    coded in the original data.
4.  Data is highly skewed, so that even the log of the data remains skewed.  A
    lognormal density is not appropriate for these data.

We need to return to how we interpreted the raw data, in particular
understanding how we ended up with nominal uncensored values at the censored
value of 1.9 and 2.0.  (This is consistent with a pattern observed in the
related Beaches data, where we had an excess of observations at the lower
reporting limit).

That may reflect the way we determined whether a sample was censored -- by
looking for a less than sign ("<") in the original data.  We could have
alternatively looked at whether the raw col and coliscore values were identical.

So let's go to the the trouble of reshaping our data the way we really want.

```{r}
coli_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(ColiVal)) %>%
  group_by(GROW_AREA, YEAR) %>%
  summarize(gmColi = exp(mean(log(ColiVal))),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(YEAR, gmColi, color=GROW_AREA)) + geom_line(lwd=2)
```

So, geometric means vary year to year and Growing Area to Growing Area.  We
obviously need indications of variability  to raw any conclusions, but this
points in useful directions.

## Histograms
First, a histogram of the log of the fecal coliform numbers. 

```{r}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(log10(ColiVal))) +
  geom_histogram(aes(color=RCFlag | LCFlag), bins = 100)
```

And then a log-log histogram. A Pareto random variable produces a linear
relation on in a log-log histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(ColiVal)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(color=RCFlag | LCFlag), bins = 100) +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

As suggested before, this is a strongly skewed, heavy-tailed distribution.
So, Gamma, Exponential, and perhaps Pareto distributions might work, but that 
nearly linear decline int eh histogram suggests a Pareto-style distribution
(with added complications due to censoring).

## Rank Correlations
```{r}
coli_data %>% 
  select(Temp, Sal, ColiVal, YEAR) %>%
  correlate(method = 'spearman')
```

So, no strong linear rank correlations.  Correlations are slightly lower using
Pearson correlations.  Weak correlations with Temperature and Salinity and
salinity and fecal coliform are likely meaningful.  Also, there may be
non-linear relationships at play.  The salinity to year correlation is
unexpected....

```{r}
coli_data %>% 
  select(Temp, Sal, ColiVal, YEAR) %>%
  mutate(ColiVal = log10(ColiVal)) %>%
  ggpairs(lower = list(continuous=wrap('smooth_loess', color='red')),
          progress=FALSE)
```

So, data are very highly scattered, obscuring patterns even when the fecal
coliform counts are log transformed. It appears fecal coliform Levels are weakly
related to salinity and temperature, which are not especially correlated
themselves.  The highly skewed fecal coliform data is problematic.

```{r}
coli_data %>%
  select(DOY, Month, YEAR, ColiVal) %>%
  mutate(ColiVal = log10(ColiVal)) %>%
  ggpairs(lower = list(continuous=wrap('smooth_loess', color='red')), progress=FALSE) 
```

No strong  patterns with time of year, month, or year, except weak relationships
to time of year. Obvious artifacts due to the discrete nature of values of the
fecal coliform data at low values. Fewer late-year observations from 2019, so we
probably need to either model time of year or remove 2019 from the data
entirely.

# Statistical Considerations
The highly skewed and heavy-tailed nature of the distribution suggests that any
form of linear model or generalized linear model to predict the observed values
will be difficult.

The data is distributed approximately Pareto, so perhaps it could be modeled
with a Pareto GLM (over a fixed support of perhaps 0:inf, or 1:inf). The
package VGAM supports such Pareto GLMs.

It may be more appropriate to transform observations into exceedances of one or
more thresholds, and analyze the probability of exceedances with a binomial
or quasi-binomial GLM.

A final alternative may be to use a one-dimensional PERMANOVA to analyze the
observed data. Using euclidean distance metric, this is equivalent to an ANOVA
analysis, but with standard errors and significance levels driven by permutation
tests rather than assumptions of normality.  I am not certain how well that 
would work with these data's heavy tails.

If we are willing to forego the modeling sophistication possible with linear
models, we might be able to test for differences in medians by classes using a
rank-based procedure, such as Wilcoxon / Kruskal-Wallis, etc.

## Why are we doing this analysis anyway?
Selection of methods here hinges on our analytic goals. To some extent, those
goals are unclear, which complicates planning of the analysis. Results of
analysis will end up as one or two graphics in State of the Bay.  The most
important graphic will be a map of some sort of levels of risk or concern.
Another graphic could be used to show off interesting relationships, such has
between levels of contamination and time of year, temperature, or salinity.  A
third possibility is that results could be used to create some sort of
geospatial analysis looking for correlations with nearby land use.

In the State of the Bay Report we want to convey certain messages:
1. Some sites are more likely to have high bacteria counts than others -- and
   we'd like to show that as a map.
2. We'd like to be able to give some explanation for some of those differences.
3. We may want to show relationships to other predictors, including time of
   year, rainfall, salinity, temperature, land use etc.
4. We'd like to see whether sites falling under different classifications have
   expected differences in probability of extreme values.

So, our core need is for some sort of summary statistic for individual sites
that we can use to show geographic patterns.  The second need is for models that
allow us to explore the impact of both categorical and quantitative predictors.

Here are the criteria used for establishing shellfish harvest area

# Relevant Standards
## Growing Area Classification Standards
Growing Area Classification | Activity Allowed |	Geometric mean FC/100ml	| 90th Percentile (P90) FC/100ml
----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------
Approved	               | Harvesting allowed	                                                      | ≤ 14	              | ≤ 31
Conditionally Approved	 | Harvesting allowed except during specified conditions	                  | ≤ 14 in open status	| ≤ 31 in open status
Restricted	             | Depuration harvesting or relay only	                                    | ≤ 88 and >15	      | ≤ 163 and >31
Conditionally Restricted |Depuration harvesting or relay allowed except during specified conditions	| ≤ 88 in open status	| ≤ 163 in open status
Prohibited	             | Aquaculture seed production only	                                        | >88	                |>163

So, critical levels for Geometric Mean include:
$<=14$ and  $<= 88$
and for the p90
$< 31$ and $<= 163$

## Maine State Class SB Waters Standards
Maine's water quality criteria includes an additional standard, which applies
only indirectly to these data:  
> the number of enterococcus bacteria in these waters may not exceed a geometric
  mean of 8 CFU per 100   milliliters in any 90-day interval or 54 CFU per 100
  milliliters in more than 10% of the samples in any 90-day interval.
  
  38 M.R.S. §465-B(2)(B)

A "90 day interval" might apply to a summer's worth of data, but in most years 
that will only represent a handful of observations at each site. Also note that
this standard is written in terms of "enterococci", not "fecal coliform" or 
"coliformes".

## Evaluation
We can readily calculate a geometric mean for each site -- which is the basis on
which shellfish area closures are calculated -- but we can not readily model
geometric means for this distribution.  The most straight forward way to do that
would be to analyze the log of counts, but even the log of the raw data is
highly skewed, and heavy tailed.
